**Project**: Bert R. Hybels, Inc Rack Tracker

# Introduction
The Cart Tracking System was developed to meet Bert R. Hybels' requirements for efficiently tracking carts using QR codes. Its primary goals are to facilitate seamless communication among growers, customers, and the hub, while ensuring the constant availability of cart location and configuration data. The system caters to three user types: admins, hub workers, and drivers.

Admins possess the ability to access crucial cart information and make necessary modifications when required. Drivers can validate the arrival and pickup of carts at customers' locations and access a route summary to optimize their delivery process. Hub workers have the authority to update cart information, including location and configuration. This comprehensive system successfully fulfills all the established requirements defined by the team and Bert R. Hybels, effectively addressing his specific needs.

# Objective
The objective of the Cart Tracking Django web application is to replace the old-fashioned
structure with a digitalized, and organized system. As a hub worker, the system will
accelerate the process of recording cart locations and cart configurations.

As an administrator, the system will provide easy management of all cart information as well
as additional cart-related functionalities such as generating new IDs for carts and printing
cart IDs. Additionally, this system will help administrators in scheduling drivers to pick up
empty carts from customers as well as gauging if a grower requires additional carts of a
certain configuration.

Finally, as a driver, this system will enhance their delivery process by providing them with
necessary cart information. The system will also allow drivers to provide secondary
validation to the hub about incoming and outgoing carts.
